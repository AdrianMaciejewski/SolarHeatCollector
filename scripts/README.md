# Logging and Plotting Tools

This guide provides instructions on how to use two Python scripts:

1. **CSV Conversion Script**: Converts Arduino serial output logs to a structured CSV file.
2. **Plotting Script**: Generates a graph of temperatures over time from the CSV file.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib
  ```

---

## CSV Conversion Script

### Description
This script processes a log file containing Arduino serial data, extracts lines starting with `[DATA]`, and converts them into a structured CSV file.

### Usage
```bash
python convert_to_csv.py <log_file_path> <output_csv_path>
```

### Parameters
- `<log_file_path>`: Path to the input log file (e.g., `serial_output.log`).
- `<output_csv_path>`: Path where the CSV file will be saved (e.g., `output/data.csv`).

### Example
```bash
python convert_to_csv.py serial_output.log output/data.csv
```

### Output
The script generates a CSV file where each column represents a data type, such as `Time (ms)`, `Rod Temperature`, `Green Cord Temperature`, etc.

---

## Plotting Script

### Description
This script takes a CSV file (generated by the CSV Conversion Script) and creates a graph of temperatures over time. The graph is saved as an image file.

### Usage
```bash
python plot_temperatures.py <input_csv> <output_file>
```

### Parameters
- `<input_csv>`: Path to the input CSV file (e.g., `output/data.csv`).
- `<output_file>`: Path where the graph image will be saved (e.g., `output/temperature_graph.png`).

### Example
```bash
python plot_temperatures.py output/data.csv output/temperature_graph.png
```

### Output
The script generates a graph displaying:
- `Rod Temperature`
- `Green Cord Temperature`
- `Average Temperature`

The x-axis represents time (in seconds), and the y-axis represents temperature (in degrees Celsius).

## Notes

1. Ensure your log file contains lines starting with `[DATA]` for successful CSV conversion.
2. For dynamic graph customization, modify the plotting script as needed.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **File Not Found Error**:
  Ensure the file paths provided to the scripts are correct and accessible.

- **Missing Columns in CSV**:
  Ensure the log file contains all necessary data types for proper CSV conversion.
